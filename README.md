## Target is one of the world’s most recognized brands and one of America’s leading retailers. Target makes itself a preferred shopping destination by offering outstanding value, inspiration, innovation and an exceptional guest experience that no other retailer can deliver.
This analysis has been done using 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at Target in Brazil. Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers.

The analysis of e-commerce data in the Brazilian market provides valuable insights into customer buying patterns, sales trends, payment preferences, and delivery experiences. By understanding these patterns and trends, businesses can make informed decisions and implement strategies to optimize their operations and drive growth. Here are the key takeaways from the analysis:

* The state of SP dominates the e-commerce market in Brazil, indicating the need to focus on other states for potential growth opportunities.
* Analyzing customer demographics can help tailor products and marketing strategies to specific target audiences, leading to increased sales.
* Offering discounts during off-peak seasons can incentivize customers and boost sales during slower periods.
